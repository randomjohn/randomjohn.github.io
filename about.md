I'm a statistician living in the Upstate SC area (Greenville/Spartanburg). 

### Description

This blog is designed to supplement my blog over at [Realizations in Biostatistics](http://realizationsinbiostatistics.blogspot.com). This part is geared more toward data analysis, basically because I can write my blog posts in R Markdown. 

If you want to create a blog on Github (you get one personal one for free), look [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). To use RStudio to blog on Github, look [here](http://andysouth.github.io/blog-setup/).

### Upstate Data Analytics group

The [Upstate Data Analytics group](https://www.meetup.com/Greenville-Data-Science-Analytics-Meetup/) meets (mostly) monthly.
