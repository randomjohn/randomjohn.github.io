I'm a statistician living in the Upstate SC area (Greenville/Spartanburg) with an interest in Bayesian methodology, machine learning, and open data. For my day job, I design and analyze clinical trials, with an emphasis in oncology and neurology. I also step out and do consulting work on an _ad hoc_ basis. Finally, I participate in the Upstate Data Science and Analytics meetup.

# Description

This blog is designed to supplement my blog over at [Realizations in Biostatistics](http://realizationsinbiostatistics.blogspot.com). This part is geared more toward data analysis, basically because I can write my blog posts in R Markdown and push them to a Github-hosted site. Blogger doesn't make that very easy.

If you want to create a blog on Github (you get one personal one for free), look [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). To use RStudio to blog on Github, look [here](http://andysouth.github.io/blog-setup/).

The [Upstate Data Science and Analytics group](https://www.meetup.com/Greenville-Data-Science-Analytics-Meetup/) meets (mostly) monthly.
